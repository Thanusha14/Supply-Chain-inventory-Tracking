    "## <u>What is Supply Chain Inventory Tracking ??</u>\n",
    "Supply Chain Inventory Tracking is a critical component of modern supply chain management, enabling businesses to monitor, manage, and optimize their inventory levels in real-time. It involves the systematic tracking of products, materials, and goods as they move through various stages of the supply chain—from suppliers to manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and finally to customers. Effective inventory tracking ensures that businesses can meet customer demand, minimize costs, and avoid stockouts or overstock situations.\\\n",
    "In today's fast-paced and competitive market, businesses rely on advanced technologies and data-driven approaches to maintain accurate and up-to-date inventory records.\\\n",
    "By leveraging advanced data structures and programming principles, this system provides a reliable and efficient solution for tracking inventory, preventing stockouts, and improving overall supply chain performance. \n",
    "## <u>Key Features of the System</u>\n",
    "* Efficient Inventory Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "   The system uses an AVL Tree data structure to store and manage inventory data. AVL Trees provide O(log n) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations, making them ideal for handling large inventories with frequent updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Real-Time Stock Updates:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The system supports real-time updates to stock levels, ensuring that inventory data is always accurate and up-to-date. This is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions and respond quickly to changes in demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Low-Stock Alerts and Reorder Suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The system automatically monitors stock levels and triggers low-stock alerts when the quantity of a product falls below a predefined threshold. It also provides reorder suggestions to help businesses replenish their inventory in a timely manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <u>Why is Supply Chain Inventory Tracking Important?</u>\n",
    "* **Prevents Stockouts and Overstocking:**\n",
    "    By maintaining optimal inventory levels, businesses can avoid stockouts (which lead to lost sales) and overstocking (which increases storage costs).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improves Customer Satisfaction:**\n",
    "    Accurate inventory tracking ensures that products are available when customers need them, leading to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reduces Operational Costs:**\n",
    "    Efficient inventory management minimizes waste, reduces storage costs, and improves cash flow by avoiding unnecessary purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Enables Data-Driven Decision Making:**\n",
    "    Real-time inventory data provides valuable insights into demand patterns, enabling businesses to make informed decisions about purchasing, production, and distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <u> OOPs concepts</u>\n",
    "1. Encapsulation – Protects Product attributes using methods like update_stock().\n",
    "2. Abstraction – Hides AVL tree operations; users call add_product().\n",
    "\n",
    "## <u> What is AVL Tree?</u>\n",
    "  An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree (BST) where the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees of any node (called the balance factor) is at most 1. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced, which guarantees O(log n) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## <u> Code Structure and Design</u>\n",
    "### *Class*\n",
    "1. AVLNode (Represents a Product)\n",
    "* Attributes (Instance Variables)\n",
    "    - product_id: (int) Unique identifier for the product.\n",
    "    - name: (str) Product name.\n",
    "    - category: (str) Product category (e.g., Electronics, appliances).\n",
    "    - stock: (int) Number of available items.\n",
    "    - price: (float) Price of a single unit.\n",
    "    - supplier: (str) Supplier's name.\n",
    "    - height: (int) Height of the node (for AVL balancing).\n",
    "    - left: (AVLNode) Pointer to the left subtree.\n",
    "    - right: (AVLNode) Pointer to the right subtree.\n",
    "* Methods\n",
    "    - __init__(): Constructor to initialize the node.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. AVLTree\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attributes:\n",
    "    - root (Product): The root node of the AVL tree (initially None).\n",
    "* Methods:\n",
    "    - insert(product: Product): Inserts a product into the AVL tree, maintaining the tree's balance.\n",
    "    - delete(product_id: str): Deletes a product from the AVL tree based on its ID.\n",
    "    - search(product_id: str): Searches for a product by its ID and returns the corresponding product object.\n",
    "    - in_order_traversal(): Traverses the tree in-order to display products and stock levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. InventoryManager & Alert system\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attributes:\n",
    "    - avl_tree (AVLTree): Instance of the AVL Tree for storing products.\n",
    "    - low_stock_alerts (list): A list of products that need to be reordered.\n",
    "    - alerts (list): List to hold low-stock alerts.\n",
    "* Methods:\n",
    "    - add_product(product: Product): Adds a product to the inventory (calls insert in AVLTree).\n",
    "    - remove_product(product_id: str): Removes a product from the inventory.\n",
    "    - update_stock(product_id: str, amount: int): Updates the stock of a product (calls update_quantity in Product).\n",
    "    - generate_low_stock_alerts(): Generates a list of products with stock below the threshold and adds them to low_stock_alerts.\n",
    "    - generate_reorder_suggestions(): Recommends reordering products based on stock levels.\n",
    "    - send_alert(product: Product): Sends an alert when stock is low.\n",
    "    - display_alerts(): Displays all current low-stock alerts.\n",
